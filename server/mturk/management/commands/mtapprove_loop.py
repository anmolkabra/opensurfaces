"""
.. describe:: ./manage mtapprove_loop '<regex>'

    Instantly approve all submissions, the moment they arrive.  In a loop, this
    script finds all experiments whose ``slug`` matches the given regex and
    approves all submitted assignments.

    I suggest running this script whenever you have an experiment that has
    sentinel objects (secret items with known answers), since workers greatly
    appreciate speedy approval.
